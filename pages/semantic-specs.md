## Dictionary and Codes

All domain specific specifications are constructed from the UN/CEFACT core component dictionary and code lists. These are published as browsable models and as a JSON-LD linked data model via the [dictionary](https://edi3.org/dictionary/) specification. Independent of the domain specific reference API specifications, implementers may simply make use of JSON-LD contexts in the published dictionary.
