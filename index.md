# UN/CEFACT Standards for Web Developers

## Purpose of this site

[UN/CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact/) has provided global leadership in electronic data interchange (EDI) standards for many decades. The majority of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) electronic documents exchanged globally today are based on UN/CEFACT standards such as [UN/EDIFACT](http://www.unece.org/cefact/edifact/welcome.html) and [XML Sschema](http://www.unece.org/cefact/xml_schemas/index). In most cases these EDIFACT or XML documents are exchanged between businesses via intermediary platforms known as EDI hubs. 

The rise of web platforms that exchange data via RESTful JSON APIs presents a new paradigm for B2B data exchange between web platforms.  But developers of web platforms rarely look to publishers like UN/CEFACT to guide the design of their APIs.
